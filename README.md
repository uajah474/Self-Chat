A simple offline Self - Interaction model that simulates realtime Web based Chat application.

Created By: Uchenna Ajah

**DESCRIPTION**

SELF CHAT Is a one to one chat box that sends and receives chat messages in a simulative manner to live chat system. 

Unlike a real web communication system, it does not use Ajax or php, nor does it store messages in any database or new page.

The application was created using HTML, CSS & JavaScript **Only!**. Thus, messages are sent from a single html page and received in the chat box of that same page.

**INSTALLATION**

To see how it works: 
* Download the SelfChat.zip file 
* Extract the SelfChat folder into any location in your local drive.
* In the extracted folder, open SelfChat.html in your browser.

**COMPACTIBILITY**

This is only a web based application created using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. It can be opened and run on any browser. 

Some very old (non updated) browser that uses deprecated codes may no support its functionality.

It also works on mobile.

**HOW IT WORKS**

* Input a username of a (fictional) friend
* Write a message and send
* Message Displays in the chat box from _you_ or _friend_
* Each message switch turns between you and friend.
* to retype, switch back turn by clicking _switch_ or sending a message on an empty input field.

**FEATURES**

* It is easy to use and understand
* It's fun
* It lets you create imaginary conversation between you and a friend.
* works on mobile browser

**Warning**

If you rename any file or change the location of any file that is in the extracted SelfChat folder, it will no longer make effects in the selfchat.html page

**Demerit**

* It is a Self Chat App
    * You cannot chat with a user from another computer.
    * You are a representation of yourself and your fictional friend.
* It is simple
    * it does not contain smilies.
    * it does not have picture upload and some other chat options

**CONCEPTION**

It would not be less fun if it was made to work with ajax and php for multiple user interaction, but the ideal concept was to simulate a functional chat model that is 100% offline.

**COPYRIGHT**

The scripts may be shared and used only for fun or learning purpose. Changing the Creator's identity or copyright notice of this system is strictly prohibited.

Modification of the extracted script may be allowed to programmers who have develop workaholic ideas from this model but they must not retain engineering of the SelfChat model or script.
