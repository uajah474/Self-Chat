Created By: Uchenna Ajah

**DESCRIPTION**

SELF CHAT as the name implies is a self chat web app that sends and receives messages from one's self. 

Unlike a real web communication system, it does not use Ajax or php, nor does it store messages in any database or new page.

The application is made using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Thus, messages are sent from a single html page and received in the chat box of that same page.

**RUN THE PROGRAM** 

* Download the SelfChat.zip file 
* Extract the SelfChat folder into any location in your local drive.
* In the extracted folder, open SelfChat.html in your browser.

**COMPACTIBILITY**

This is only a web based application created using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. It can run on any mobile or desktop browser. 

**HOW IT WORKS**

* Input a username of a (fictional) friend
* Write a message and send
* Message Displays in the chat box from _you_ or _friend_
* Each message switch turns between you and friend.
* to retype, switch back turn by clicking _switch_ or sending a message on an empty input field.

**Demerit**

* It is a Self Chat App
    * You cannot chat with a user from another computer.
    * You are a representation of yourself and your fictional friend.
* It is simple
    * it does not contain smilies.
    * it does not have picture upload and some other chat options

**CONCEPTION**

It would not be less fun if it was made to work with ajax and php for multiple user interaction, but the ideal concept was to simulate a functional chat model that is 100% offline.
